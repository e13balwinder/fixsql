We are initiating a comprehensive security assessment of our SQL Server estate, including the underlying virtual machine infrastructure. The goal of this initiative is to proactively identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities, ensure compliance with our security policies and industry best practices, and ultimately enhance the overall security posture of our critical database systems.

To facilitate this, we have compiled a detailed checklist covering a wide range of security aspects. This checklist, titled "Comprehensive SQL Server and VM Security Assessment Checklist," has been shared with you [mention how it's shared, e.g., "and can be accessed here: [Link to document/shared location]" or "and is attached for your review." If you are using this in a collaborative environment where the checklist is visible, you can say "and is available in our shared workspace."].

The assessment will review key areas including, but not limited to:

VM and Host Security: Hardening, patching, access controls, and network security for our hypervisor hosts and guest VMs.

SQL Server Instance Security:

Installation and configuration best practices.

Authentication mechanisms (Windows vs. SQL, sa account, password policies).

Authorization and permissions (roles, least privilege).

Data protection (encryption at rest and in transit, TDE, Always Encrypted).

Auditing and logging configurations.

Security of Linked Servers.

Certificate management for SSL/TLS and encryption features.

SQL Server Agent security.

Security of other components like SSRS, SSAS, and SSIS.

General Security Practices: Including backup and disaster recovery, change management, and incident response as they pertain to the SQL environment.

We kindly request that your team review this checklist thoroughly and prepare to conduct these assessments across the SQL Server instances under your management. This will be a significant undertaking, and your expertise and cooperation are crucial for its success.

Please let me know your initial thoughts and if you foresee any immediate challenges or require clarification on any part of the checklist. We can schedule a meeting next week to discuss the scope, timelines, and a plan for executing this assessment.

Thank you for your attention to this critical initiative.

Best regards,
